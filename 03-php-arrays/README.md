You're nearly done. This task is much simpler than the last but ideally you'll be completing it in PHP.

If you don't have PHP experience and would prefer to do this in another language then that is ok.

All we want you to do is create a simple array and a keyed array (this is known in other languages as a map).

The simple array should contain a list of people.
Create a function or class that selects a random person from the simple array and prints it to the screen.

The second, keyed array (or map) should have keys that are people's names. The array item's value should be a favorite color.
Create a function or a class that selects a random person's name and favorite color from the array and prints it to the screen. 

If you have PHP on your computer or on a server, feel free to use that. If you don't, take a look at http://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/

Include any .php files in this folder. 

Once you're done with this task you should go back to the main instructions and submit your code as a Github pull request. After that you'll be all done!
